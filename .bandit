# Skip specific security checks that are acceptable in this context
skips:
  # B101 - Assert used (common in tests, but also used in some runtime checks)
  - B101

  # B110 - Try/except with broad exception + pass (defensive error handling)
  # These are intentional - ignoring errors during cleanup/shutdown operations
  - B110

  # B112 - Try/except with SystemExit/continue (legitimate for CLI/file processing)
  # Used for graceful error handling in loops and CLI applications
  - B112

  # B301 - Pickle usage (may be needed for vector database caching)
  - B301

  # B311 - Random usage (may be needed for AI response randomization)
  - B311

  # B404 - Import of subprocess (needed for system calls in tools)
  - B404

  # B603 - Subprocess without shell=True (may be needed for security)
  - B603
